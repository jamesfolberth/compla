I made a symbolic link to libcompla.so in /usr/lib (that's in the default ld path)

I made a symbolic link to this directory in /usr/include so I can get at the .mod (module) files.  Pass -I /usr/include/libcompla to gfortran.

compla.f08 -> libcompla.so

test.f08 has a bunch of test routines to check the routines in compla.f08 (libcompla.so)

If you're linking with openBLAS, call openblas_set_num_threads(N) in the code
